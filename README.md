About
----

Static analysis tools and IDE usually struggle to understand python binary extensions.
`pybind11-stubgen` generates [stubs](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/) for python extensions to make them less opaque.

While the CLI tool includes tweaks to target modules compiled specifically
with [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) but it should work well with modules built with other libraries.

```bash
# Install
pip install pybind11-stubgen

# Generate stubs for numpy
pybind11-stubgen numpy
```
