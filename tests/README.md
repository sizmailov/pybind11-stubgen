# Test project structure

The setup mocks the following project structure:

1. A C++ library (C++/CMake): [`demo-lib`](demo-lib)
2. Bindings of C++ library as shared object (C++/CMake): [`py-demo/bindings`](py-demo/bindings)
3. Bindings of C++ library as python module (Python): [`py-demo`](py-demo)
