‚ö†Ô∏è Project was rewritten from scratch for `1.x`. This allowed me to address some long-standing issues, but I might
accidentally brake behaviour you relied on.

Changes:

- Replaced regex-based signature parsing with more robust procedure which enables to produce partially degraded
  signatures
- Added type parsing/replacing, including deeply annotated types
- Support implicit imports required for static analysis
- Add introspection of pure python functions
- Support python 3.10+ only (temporarily)
- Improved structure of test binary pybind module
