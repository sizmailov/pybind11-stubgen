Changelog
=========

Version 2.2.1 (Sep 23, 2023)
--------------------------
Changes:
- 🐛 fix: Missing `-?` in eum representation regex


Version 2.2.1 (Sep 23, 2023)
--------------------------
Changes:
- 📝 Update `--print-invalid-expressions-as-is` description

Version 2.2 (Sep 20, 2023)
--------------------------
Changes:

- 🐛 Fix: Python literals as default arg rendered as `...` (#147)
- ✨ Add `--print-safe-value-reprs=REGEX` CLI option to override the print-safe flag
     of Value (for custom default value representations provided via `pybind11::arg_v()`)  (#147)
- ✨ Add `--enum-class-locations=REGEX:LOC` CLI option to rewrite enum values as valid
     Python expressions with correct imports. (#147)

⚠️ This release detects more invalid expressions in bindings code.
  Previously Enum-like representations (e.g. `<MyEnum.Zero: 0>`) were always treated
  as non-printable values and were rendered as `...`.
  The invalid expressions should be acknowledged by `--enum-class-locations` or `--ignore-invalid-expressions`.

⚠️ Project was rewritten from scratch for `1.x`. This allowed me to address some long-standing issues, but I might
accidentally brake behaviour you relied on.

Changes:

- Updated CLI interface, some options were removed, please see `pybind11-stubgen --help` for details
- Replaced regex-based signature parsing with more robust procedure which enables to produce partially degraded
  signatures
- Added type parsing/replacing, including deeply annotated types
- Support implicit imports required for static analysis
- Add introspection of pure python functions
- Support python 3.10+ only (temporarily)
- Improved structure of test binary pybind module
